This repository demonstrates an example of an uncommon error in Python. Specifically, it showcases a ZeroDivisionError that occurs only under a specific condition within a conditional statement.  The bug is explained in detail in the `bug.py` file, along with a solution in the `bugSolution.py` file.  This simple example highlights the importance of careful consideration of edge cases and potential errors when using conditional logic.
